# Curriculum Vitae

This is a [gohugo](https://gohugo.io/) static website used to generate a CV.

The config.toml is the one used to generate the website.

## Modifying the CV to french

A french version of the CV is accessible to generate a french version of the CV.
This can be done by renaming the "config_fr.toml" to "config.toml". The "fr.yaml" has to be renamed "en.yaml" located in "./themes/hugo-devresume-theme/i18n/".
